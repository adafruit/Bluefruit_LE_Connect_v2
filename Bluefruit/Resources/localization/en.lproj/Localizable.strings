Configure your Bluefruit LE hardware using instructions found here:
http://www.adafruit.com/bluefruitle

Drag the table down and release to clear the list of found peripherals and begin scanning

Tap a row in the table to view a peripheral's advertisement data.

Each peripheral's Received Signal Strength (RSSI) is displayed to the left of its name.

Tap a row's connect button to connect the corresponding device in one of the available modes:

• Info - displays peripheral services & characteristics

• UART - basic terminal, send & receive data 

• Pin I/O - uses Bluefruit's UART to control Arduino running BLEFirmata sketch:
https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-the-nrf8001-bluefruit-le-breakout/software-bluefruit-firmata

• Controller - streams sensor data from your iOS device to Bluefruit LE over UART

• Plotter - can be used to plot incoming numeric data in a chart

• Updates - update device firmware
